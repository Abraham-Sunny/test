RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. 

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time. 

It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship. 

The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works. 

RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. 

She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. 

Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. 

Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship.
